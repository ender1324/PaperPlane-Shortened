<h1 align="center">PaperPlane-Shortened</h1>
<h2 align="center">The popular telegram bot paperplane extended but its worse and in js (but eventually opening new possibilities)</h2>
<p>The bot is in developent, there isnt anything here yet, when its ready everything will be uploaded here</p>
<strong>This is the testing branch, DO NOT use this if you want a WORKING USERBOT, </strong>
<strong>This branch is only for saving my experiments and it will be unusable very often, use pps-staging if you want the lastest features</strong>
